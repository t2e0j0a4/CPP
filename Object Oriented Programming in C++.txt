Helps to see programm with real-world scenario.
Data Security Compromised.
Works on concept of classes and objects.
Treats data as critical element.

Terminology of OOP's
    1.Classes
    2.Objects
    3.Data Abstraction
    4.Encapsulation
    5.Inheritence
    6.Polymorphism
    7.Dynamic Binding
    8.Message Passing

Benefits
    1.Code Reusebility
    2.Multiple Objects exists.
    3.Easily Software complexity can be managed.
    4.Data Hiding helps build secure systems.

C++ was initially called as - 'C with Classes'.
classes are extension of structures.
structures had limitations:
    1.Members are public.
    2.Cant able to use methods.
classes can have members as private and also public.
We can't assess private members outside class.
